            you capture and send to us. The biometric identifiers used to

            Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction
          </Typography>
          <Typography color='textSecondary' marginBottom={1.5}>
            You may inquire as to whether Mochimo is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend, or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to support@Mochimo.com or use any of the methods set out in this Policy to request access to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Mochimo. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
          </Typography>
          <Typography color='textSecondary'>
            Although Mochimo makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Mochimo is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Mochimo determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Mochimo will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
